Backend Engineering Intern: Quintin d'Hotman de Villiers:

To test the functionality of the application, an application such as POSTMAN, or the command line tool cURL should be used.
The link to the application is: https://apple-glistening-cone.glitch.me/RESTfulEndpoint where 'RESTfulEndpoint' refers to the various api endpoint calls such as 'get-users'
The site used for deploying the node.js file/application is Glitch. 
The site may take a while to first start up, anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes, as Glitch projects go to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity but wake up once the URL is accessed or files are changed on the back end.
Should you wish to copy the files and run it locally, there is a 'start' script located in package.json and all dependencies can be initialsed with npm install.
